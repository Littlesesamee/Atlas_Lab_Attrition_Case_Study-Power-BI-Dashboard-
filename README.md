# Lab Attrition Study (Power BI)

This project analyzes employee attrition using simulated HR data. The study explores **demographics, hiring trends, job satisfaction, and performance metrics** to better understand the drivers of employee turnover.

## üìä Dashboards
The report is divided into four main sections:

### 1. Overview
- Total, active, and inactive employees
- Annual hiring trends (2012‚Äì2022)
- Department- and role-level headcount distribution

### 2. Demographics
- Employee age distribution and gender split
- Marital status breakdown
- Ethnicity distribution with salary comparisons
- Insights into workforce diversity

### 3. Performance Tracker
- Interactive employee-level performance review
- Job, relationship, and environment satisfaction trends
- Work-life balance and manager ratings across review cycles

### 4. Attrition Analysis
- Overall attrition rate (16.1%)
- Attrition patterns by department, job role, tenure, and hire date
- Business travel frequency and overtime requirements as attrition drivers

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards
- **Power Query** for data transformation
- **DAX** for calculated measures
- Sample HR dataset for demonstration

## üöÄ Key Insights
- Sales and Human Resources roles show the highest attrition rates.
- Overtime requirements are strongly correlated with attrition.
- Younger employees (20‚Äì29) and early-tenure staff show higher turnover.
- Demographic factors such as marital status and ethnicity align with salary and attrition patterns.
